# Se_Project_Coffeeshop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- Iframe usage to add Youtube Videos
-

## Plan on improving the project

More instructions and chapters on animation and iframe, this was a tricky part of this along with the menu itmes. Maybe more course work to cover these areas. This project was fun.
